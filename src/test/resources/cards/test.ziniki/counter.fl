OK, so we're now hacking 3
We want to do this on a restore contract
But the thing is, that there will be cases where they only care about being initialized
		implements org.ziniki.Init
			onready
				<- timer.requestTicks (OnCounter 3) 1000

-- I think this is what we actually want here ...      
implements org.ziniki.Subscribe
load (CounterObj c)
<- timer.cancel h
h <- timer.requestTicks (OnCounter c.inc) 1000

		implements Timer timer
  
		handler OnCounter inc 
			onTick
				counter <- counter + inc
