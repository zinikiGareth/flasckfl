OK, so we're now hacking 3
We want to do this on a restore contract
But the thing is, that there will be cases where they only care about being initialized
.		implements org.ziniki.Init
.			onready
.				<- timer.requestTicks (OnCounter 3) 1000

		implements org.ziniki.KeyValue
			value (CounterObj c)
				<- timer.requestTicks (OnCounter c.inc) 1000

.				<- timer.cancel t
# should be: (capturing handle)				<- timer.requestTicks (OnCounter c.inc) 1000 -> t

		implements Timer timer
  
		handler OnCounter inc 
			onTick
				counter <- counter + inc
