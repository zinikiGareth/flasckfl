	        FLAS units are grouped into files.
	        There are no specific rules about how units are grouped and grouping
	        units together in a file offers no special privileges of access.

       This is the set of units that can be defined at the top level in files.
       Since many of these may also be defined within nested function scopes,
       this is defined as a production of those together with the others that cannot.

       These units can only be declared at the top level in a file.

	       Constants and functions can be declared either at the top level or within nested scopes.
	       When declared within a nested scope, all the surrounding variables and definitions are available
	       for reference by name.
	       Note that a complete function declaration is made up of multiple cases applying to specific patterns.
	       All of the cases must be declared “together” without any intervening blocks, but this is not
	       included in this grammar specification.
	       There are two ways to declare a function case.
	       It is possible to declare a single expression on the same line as the function declaration.
	       Or the function name and argument patterns can appear on one line, and one or more guarded equations
	       can appear on subsequent lines.
