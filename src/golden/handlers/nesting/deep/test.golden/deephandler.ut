It should be possible to call a function and pass it arguments that can be used inside a scoped handler.
The arguments obviously need to be attached to the handler implicitly as lambdas.
This is true even if the function is inside an object

	test that we can call it
		data TopHasState ths <- TopHasState.create
		data BoringHandler bh <- ths.f 5
		invoke bh.boreMe
		assert (ths.counter)
			12
