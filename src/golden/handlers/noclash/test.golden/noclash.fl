When we define handler methods in a card, the method name is "automatically" in scope.
One consequence of this is that it can clash with existing member names there such as in a state
object or another handler.

Check that we can deal with this.

	contract Fred
		noclash
		
	card Bert
		state
			String noclash
		
		implements Fred
			noclash
				noclash <- "This is not as confusing as it seems"
