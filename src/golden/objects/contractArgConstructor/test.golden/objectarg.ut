This is in part a regression and otherwise similar to objects/contracts.

In the wild, the logic of requiring contracts in objects did not work when there were arguments.

	test we can use a contract stored on a nested object
		data DoSomething helper
		data HoldContract agent
		contract agent ForTest init "gazza"
		expect helper meth "hello gazza"
		contract agent ForTest run
