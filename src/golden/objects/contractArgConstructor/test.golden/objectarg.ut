This is in part a regression and otherwise similar to objects/contracts.

In the wild, the logic of requiring contracts in objects did not work when there were arguments.

	test we can use a contract stored on an object in a card
		data DoSomething helper
		data HoldContract card
		contract card ForTest init "gazza"
		expect helper meth "hello gazza"
		expect helper meth "hello XgazzaX"
		contract card ForTest run
		
	test we can use a contract stored on an object in an agent
		data DoSomething helper
		data AgentHolder agent
		contract agent ForTest init "gazza"
		expect helper meth "hello gazza"
		expect helper meth "hello AgazzaA"
		contract agent ForTest run
