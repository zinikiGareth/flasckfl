I'm somewhat conflicted about this.  We have here a use case that makes sense, particularly if you view 'start' as a constant of some kind.

But it seems wrong to allow referencing of undefined (or defined _in_ the constructor) fields.  That should probably be called out elsewhere as an error.

	object CtorUsesState
		state
			Number start <- 42
			Number curr
		
		ctor init
			curr <- start
		
		acor top = curr
		
		method next
			curr <- curr + 1
