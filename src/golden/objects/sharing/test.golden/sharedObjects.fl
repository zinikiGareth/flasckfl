This is the object which should be created once and shared

	object ToShare
		state
			String value
			
		ctor makeMeOnce (String s)
			value <- s
		
		method andUpdate (String t)
			value <- t
			
		acor export = value
			
To facilitate the testing, we will also have an object which takes the shared reference.

	object Container
		state
			ToShare shared
			
		ctor holdIt (ToShare s)
			shared <- s
			
		acor nested = shared.export

And then we need another object to manage the whole process ...

	object RunTest
		state
			Container container
			ToShare myRef
			
		ctor setup
			myRef <- shareMe
			container <- fred
				fred = Container.holdIt shareMe		
				shareMe = ToShare.makeMeOnce "hello"

		method changeValue (String s)
			<- myRef.andUpdate s
