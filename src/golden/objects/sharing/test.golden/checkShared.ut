Everywhere that a no-args function is declared, it will be represented as a closure and the evaluation
of that closure should be shared between all references.

This is obviously somewhat complicated, and probably requires a lot more testing than I have given it,
but in particular, I came across a case where it was not working with object constructors, so this is a
regression test for that.

	test check that if we update one, we update both
		data RunTest r <- RunTest.setup
		invoke r.changeValue "changed"
		assert (r.myRef.export)
			"changed"
		assert (r.container.nested)
			"changed"
