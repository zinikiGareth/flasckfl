This is basically the same as double.fl from nestedvars, but using an event handler.
I'm not sure exactly what the difference is, but something about assigning from "moveRun.head" here triggers a desire to reference ev
in a way that it isn't in the function case.
	
	object EvDeps
		state
			List[Number] runs
			
		ctor create

		event moveIt (ClickEvent ev)
			moveRun <- moveRun.head
				hc = hccast ev.source
				movecol = findColumn hc
				moveRun = item movecol runs

		hccast (Number n) = n
		hccast (Any a) = Error "no"
		findColumn (Number n) = 0
