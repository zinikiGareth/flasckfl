This is a regression test based on the fact that we had an issue with the lifter not correctly figuring
dependencies of nested vars when they were passed from hand to hand

Specifically, ev is needed in the call to moveRun to pass to movecol to pass to hc, but it was getting lost

	moveIt ev = moveRun.head
		hc = hccast ev
		movecol = findColumn hc
		moveRun = item movecol []

	hccast (Number n) = n
	hccast (Any a) = Error "no"
	findColumn (Number n) = 0
