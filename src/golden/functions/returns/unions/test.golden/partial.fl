It should be possible to define a function which returns more than a struct
but less than a whole union and have it type as if it returned the whole union

Providing, of course, only one such union exists

	struct CaseA
	struct CaseB
	struct CaseC
	
	union Cases
		CaseA
		CaseB
		CaseC
		
	func [] = CaseC
	func (Cons[A] l) = CaseB
