I have no idea what this is supposed to be testing or why it carries the name splitdefn

	guarded x
		| True = "hello"
		| False = "goodbye"

But I wanted to write some tests where I checked that you could not split the definition
of a function, so I added them here.


The function g splits the cases of split

	split Nil = 0
	g = 13
	split (Cons[A] c) = 1
	
The struct Hello splits the cases of broken

	broken Nil = 0
	
	struct Hello
		Number n
		
	broken l = 1
