This should really have one of each, but for now, just the ones we want to test

	struct Id
		String id

	struct Item
		Id id
		String title
		String format
		
	card Templates
	
		state
			Croset[Item] data

We should probably also have a list example that uses a function to get its data

		template
			.
				+ data e
					.
						e.title : (e.format)
						e.id.id
