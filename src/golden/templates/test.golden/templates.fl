This should really have one of each, but for now, just the ones we want to test

	entity Item
		String title
		String format
		
	card Templates
	
		state
			Croset[Item] data
			Item header

We should probably also have a list example that uses a function to get its data

		template
			.
				+ data e
					.
						e.title : (e.format)
						e.id.id
				header.title
				header.id.id
