The idea here is that if you have a variable, it should have just one value no matter how many
times you use it - that is, the same identical value is used in each case.

Let us assume we have some very expensive operation; we want to share the value.
 
	struct Result
		Number n
	expensiveOp = f 3
	
	f x = Result (x * x) // not actually all that expensive

	struct Pair
		Result left
		Result right
	
If we directly share it in a single expression, we can reasonably expect it to be lifted anyway

	q = Pair expensiveOp expensiveOp
	
We also need to consider the case that we have a more complex situation

	struct PairB
		Result left
		Wrapper right

	struct Wrapper
		Result foo

	r = expensiveOp
	s = PairB r (Wrapper expensiveOp)
