The idea here is to test that things in scopes work out right

	contract Reply
		down reply (Number k)

	contract Server
		up get Number Reply
		up put Number

Note: I had to specifically identify the type of "server" here in order
to get type checking to pass

Either I shouldn't need to do that, or it should give a good error message,
so we should consider that case
	
	f (Server server) x = MessageWrapper var [q]
		var = 32
		
		method q
			<- server.get var (Reply var)
			
		handler Reply HandleReply (Number v)
			reply y
				<- server.put (var + v)
