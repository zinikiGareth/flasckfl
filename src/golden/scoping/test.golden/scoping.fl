The idea here is to test that things in scopes work out right

	contract Reply
		down reply (Number k)

	contract Server
		up get (Number k) (Reply r)
		up put (Number k)

Note: I had to specifically identify the type of "server" here in order
to get method conversion to pass

Either I shouldn't need to do that, or it should give a good error message,
so we should consider that case
	
	f (Server server) x = MessageWrapper var [q]
		var = 32
		
		method q
			<- server.get var (HandleReply var)
			
		handler Reply HandleReply (Number v)
			reply y
				<- server.put (var + v)

	contract NoArg
		up get Number
	
	method cna (NoArg na)
		<- na.get 42
