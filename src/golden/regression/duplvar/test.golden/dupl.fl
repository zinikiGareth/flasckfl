This came from a parser regression example.  I thought the problem was "o" being defined twice;
but of course that was just two cases of a function.

I have left it here though because it was the only case I had of a tuple inside a function and that
led to errors.

The name, however, is misleading.

	ozkdyjz = 'c_cbwdc8hJam@g1'
		( zoc , daihmp , nfcqrm ) = (True, False, False)
			o Nil = 0

			o (Cons[Any] c) = 46
