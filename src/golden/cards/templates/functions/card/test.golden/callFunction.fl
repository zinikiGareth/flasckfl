This may look weird, but it was added to check that template bindings correctly set "haveFnState"
The function henry is here just to set it to false before the template binding function is processed.
This obviously assumes knowledge of the compiler internals and therefore is somewhat fragile - except obviously it should keep working
	
	card CallFunction
		template main
			value <- mapping []
			
		mapping [] = 'hello'
		mapping (Cons[String] msgs) = msgs.head
	
	henry = "hello"
