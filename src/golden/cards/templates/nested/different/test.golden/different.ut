	test we can render some accounts
		data HandleDifferent hd
		shove hd.records
			[Entry "first" 22, Entry "second" 13, Total 35]
		match hd text
			first 22 second 13 35

I would like to be able to do this, but it is tricky
How do you know what gets rendered in 0 to know what should be there?
It's presumably possible to handle the ambiguity somehow
Put it on the backlog

.		match hd text entries.0.desc
.			first
