The Begin contract is basically just the card start contract.

	contract Top
		subscribe

The HelpMe contract has a "help" method that then calls back into a Child contract.
This is not actually invoked.

	contract handler Child
		
	contract service HelpMe
		help -> (Child ch)
		
	card NamedTop
		requires HelpMe h
		implements Top
			subscribe
				<- h.help -> MyChild => "top"
				
		handler Child MyChild
