once created, it can be cancelled be repeating the process.

	test a named subscription is cancelled when called twice
		data HelpMe h
		data NamedTop c
		
		expect h help -> _first
		contract c Top subscribe

		expect h help -> _second
		expect <~ first
		contract c Top subscribe

	test an error occurs if a named subscription is cancelled without the expectation
		data HelpMe h
		data NamedTop c
		
		expect h help -> _first
		contract c Top subscribe

		expect h help -> _second
		contract c Top subscribe
