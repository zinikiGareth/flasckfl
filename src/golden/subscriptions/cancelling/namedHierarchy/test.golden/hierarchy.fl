	contract handler Calling
		hello (String called)

	contract service CallMe
		call -> (Calling n)

	contract handler Child

	contract service HelpMe
		help -> (Child ch)
		
	card NamedNested
		requires CallMe c
		requires HelpMe h
		implements Begin
			start called
				<- c.call -> Nested => called
		
		handler Calling Nested
			hello called
				<- h.help -> MyChild => called
		
		handler Child MyChild
