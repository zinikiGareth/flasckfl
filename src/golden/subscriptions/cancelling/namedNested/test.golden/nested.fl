The Begin contract is basically just the card start contract.

	contract Begin
		start
		
	contract handler Calling
		hello

	contract service CallMe
		call -> (Calling n)

The HelpMe contract has a "help" method that then calls back into a Child contract.
This is not actually invoked.
	
	contract handler Child

	contract service HelpMe
		help -> (Child ch)
		
	card NamedNested
		requires CallMe c
		requires HelpMe h
		implements Begin
			start
				<- c.call -> Nested
		
		handler Calling Nested
			hello
				<- h.help -> MyChild => "nested"
		
		handler Child MyChild
