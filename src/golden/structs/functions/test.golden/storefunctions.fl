It should obviously be possible to store a function in a struct and call it.
Some of the cases in which we store a function inside something else are less obvious
and specifically the "l1" case came up in the wild with a unification error.

	f (String s) = 42
	takesAny a = 42
	takesSome b = 56

	struct StoreFn
		String->Number fn
		
	x = StoreFn f
	
	struct StoreListFn
		List[String->Number] fns
		
	y = StoreListFn [f]
	
	struct StoreTupleFn
		(String, String->Number) tuple
		
	z = StoreTupleFn ("hello", f)
	
	struct StoreFnAsAny
		(String, Any) tuple
		
	a1 = StoreFnAsAny ("hello", f)
	a2 = StoreFnAsAny ("hello", takesAny)

	struct StoreListTupleWithFnAsAny
		List[(String, Any)] list
		
	m1 = StoreListTupleWithFnAsAny [("hello", "there"), ("goodbye", "world")]

	l1 = StoreListTupleWithFnAsAny [("hello", takesAny), ("goodbye", takesSome)]
