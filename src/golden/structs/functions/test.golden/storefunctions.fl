It should obviously be possible to store a function in a struct and call it.
Check that types work for that

	f (String s) = 42

	struct StoreFn
		String->Number fn
		
	x = StoreFn f
	
	struct StoreListFn
		List[String->Number] fns
		
	y = StoreListFn [f]
	
	struct StoreTupleFn
		(String, String->Number) tuple
		
	z = StoreTupleFn ("hello", f)
