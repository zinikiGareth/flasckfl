2024-01-11: I found a bug for which this is a characterisation test

The nature of the bug was that a value shared between two forks of a constructor led to an infinite loop.
It turned out that it was simply because my local variable names were v1, v2, etc and that clashed with the field names.

	struct Shared
		Any v1
		Any v2
		
	struct Value
		String name
		
	value = Value "hello"
	ret = Shared value value
