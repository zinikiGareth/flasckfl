We want to test that we can override the default initializers of a struct which expects
no arguments to begin with because it has default initializers for all of its fields

	test that the default initializers work
		assert (n1.x)
			42
		assert (n1.h)
			"hello"

	test that the hash overrides the defaults
		assert (n2.x)
			50
		assert (n2.h)
			"goodbye"
