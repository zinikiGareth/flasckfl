	test that we can evaluate the thing with no args
		assert (f0)
			TwoVals "hello" "world"
			
	test that we can evaluate the thing with one arg
		assert (f1 "world")
			TwoVals "hello" "world"


I also want a case where the constructor is an argument to a HOF

.		assert (hof TwoVals "hello")
. where hof ctor s = (ctor s) "world"
