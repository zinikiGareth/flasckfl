This is a fairly simple usage of Random borrowed from patience, which nevertheless ends up being quite complex
This is simplified by just using numbers

	list = genlist 52
	
	genlist 0 = []
	genlist k = append (genlist (k-1)) k
	
	doShuffle rs [] = []
	doShuffle (Cons[Number] rands) (Cons[Number] items) = Cons (nth which items) (doShuffle rands.tail others)
		others = concatLists [take which items, drop (which+1) items]
		len = length items 
		which = rands.head % len
