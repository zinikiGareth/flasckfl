Calendar objects are required to convert instants to and from strings
The builtin calendar is the "standard" western Gregorian calendar.
But obviously others can be defined.

	test simple conversion to ISO dates
		data Calendar cal <- Calendar.gregorian
		assert (cal.isoDateTime (fromunixdate 1601592451))
			"2020-10-01T22:47:31Z"
