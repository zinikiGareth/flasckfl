I saw cascades with duplicate members, but it was unrelated (members were not being defined if any previous errors had occurred, even if unrelated).

But I wrote this test anyway to be sure

	card DuplicateMember
		state
			String member
			Number member
			
		method m
			member <- "hello"
			
	object Unrelated
		state
			String m
			Number k <- 0
		
		ctor create
			m <- "hello"
			k <- 6
