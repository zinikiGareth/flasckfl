Implementation methods should not duplicate the type.  This is an error.

But this should not cause cascaded errors, such as that we "didn't implement the method".  We did, just wrongly.
It certainly shouldn't cause a cascade in the (initialized) fields of an unrelated object.

	contract Anything
		load (String s)
		
	card Implementor
		implements Anything
			load (String s)
			
	object Unrelated
		state
			String m
			Number k <- 0
		
		ctor create
			m <- "hello"
			k <- 6
