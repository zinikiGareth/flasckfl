This is mainly a test of typechecking.
Because we make methods dependent on the handler methods that they call, this is mutually recursive.
Thus the type of "advance" must be inferred at the same time that we are typechecking DealNext.call 

	contract service AskFor
		help -> (Response helper)
		
	contract handler Response
		coming
	
	object Dealing
		state
			AskFor repeater
			Number x <- 0
	
		ctor with (AskFor r)
			repeater <- r
			<- r.help -> DealNext
		
		method advance
			<- repeater.help -> DealNext
		
		handler Response DealNext
			coming
				<- advance
