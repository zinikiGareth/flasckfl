This is mainly a test of typechecking.
Because we make methods dependent on the handler methods that they call, this is mutually recursive.
Thus the type of "advance" must be inferred at the same time that we are typechecking DealNext.call 

	object Dealing
		state
			Repeater repeater
			Number x <- 0
	
		ctor with (Repeater r)
			repeater <- r
			<- r.callMe -> DealNext
		
		method advance
			<- repeater.callMe -> DealNext
		
		handler CallMe DealNext
			call
				<- advance
